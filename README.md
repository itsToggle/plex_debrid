# plex_debrid
Plex/Emby/Jellyfin/Infuse torrent streaming through Debrid Services, using Plex Discover Watchlists, Trakt lists and Overseerr.

Using content services like plex discover, trakt and overseerr, your personal media server users can add movies/shows to their watchlist and they become available to stream in seconds.

### In Action:

![ezgif com-gif-maker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71379623/185643627-45217303-75d8-4c9d-8c8b-41bb2e27fd87.gif)
 
### Description:

A plex_debrid setup consists of three parts.
- The first part is rclone (or rclone_rd), a program that tricks your OS into thinking you have your debrid service files locally. In reality they are streamed when you open them, which is why content is available almost instantly and why you have unlimited storage (depending on your debrid service). Nothing is ever actually downloaded to your servers harddrive.
- The second part is a personal media server like Plex, which allows you to watch these files from anywhere on any device.
- The third part is the plex_debrid script, which ties both things together and provides an easy way to add media content to your debrid service/s.

The plex_debrid script monitors the plex watchlists, trakt watchlists and overseer-requests of specified users for newly added movies/shows and newly released episodes of watchlisted shows. 
Once new content is found, torrent indexers are scraped for the best, cached release on selected debrid services. 
The torrent is then added to a suitable debrid service and a library refresh is performed to make the newly added content available. 

**For any debrid-cached content (movies, one-season tv shows or even multi-season tv shows) the entire process from watchlisting content to watching it takes about 10-20 seconds.**

This is a work in progress, and im not a professional programmer. shits not ready! Feel free to check it out though, I will continously improve the speed, reliability and user-friendlyness.

### 1) :open_file_folder: Mount your debrid services:

*For this download automation to work, you need to mount at least one debrid service as a virtual drive. I highly recommend using RealDebrid, as this service will recieve updates and new features from plex_debrid first. Please keep in mind that most debrid services dont allow you to access their service from multiple IP addresses in parallel. This is not an issue if you have a Plex server running, since everything you stream through plex (from any location, no matter how many in parallel) is routed through your servers IP address. While you have your plex server running though, you should not download from your debrid service in any other way than through plex.*

>  
>  Realdebrid has now implement support for WebDav, which makes it mountable with official rclone software.
>  
>  I do still recomend using my forked version of rclone thats written explicitly for realdebrid, since realdebrids WebDav does not allow for torrent file deletion through rclone and they limit the amount of torrents displayed to 200. They do claim the torrent file deletion works with other webdav mount programs, but i have not been able to test this yet. It also seems that the official realdebrid webdav is still slower and more bandwidth heavy than my rclone fork, because mounting the webdav leads to frequent re-discovering of already downloaded content.

### 2) :tv: Setup your personal media server:

*To stream content from your newly mounted virtual drive, its recommended to set up a personal media server like plex, emby or jellyfin. These services allow you to stream your content from outside your local network. You will have the best expirience when using plex, since you dont need any 3rd party website to download new content - you can simply add new movies/shows to your watchlist from inside any plex client app, wait a few seconds and then watch it (see the gif above). If you prefer emby or jellyfin as your personal media server, the only way to add new content is via trakt and jellyseerr. A different approach is to use media players like Infuse to access the mounted files, which too relies on trakt to add new content.*

><details>
>  <summary><b><u><img src="https://app.plex.tv/desktop/favicon.ico" height="16"> Setting up Plex:</u></b></summary>
>  
>  1. Create a plex 'movie' library of the mounted virtual drive or add the virtual drive to an existing 'movie' library.
>  2. Create a plex 'shows' library of the mounted virtual drive or add the virtual drive to an existing 'shows' library.
>  3. *If you are running rclone on a Linux based OS and Plex cant find your mounted virtual drive, try adding the mounting tag '--allow-other'*
>  4. *Recommendation: disable 'video preview thumbnails', disable the scheduled task 'perfom extensive media analysis' to reduce the download traffic. If you are planning on having a very large library, increase your libraries cache size from the default 40MB to 1GB.*
>  5. Disable the libary setting "Empty trash after every scan", to make sure that no content is removed accidentaly
>  6. You and your home users can now stream cached torrents from your debrid service/s!
>  
>  **Please keep your libraries metadata agent as the default Plex metadata agent**

### :cloud: Rclone Usage

*Some advanced options for using rclone*

><details>
>  <summary><b><u>4K & HD libraries:</u></b></summary>
>  
>  - Using rclone filtering, you can split your library into 4k and non-4k content.
>  - start one instance of rclone by adding the flag `--exclude **2160**` to your mount command, mount to a folder named "HD"
>  - start another instance of rclone by adding the flag `--include **2160**` to your mount command, mount to a folder named "4K"
>
></details>
>
><details>
>  <summary><b><u>Movie/Show sorting for WebDAV remotes:</u></b></summary>
>  
>  - Using rclone filtering, you can split your WebDAV remote into movie and show content.
>  - start one instance of rclone by adding the flag `--exclude "**{{(s|S)([0-9]+)( |.|e|E)}}**"` to your mount command, mount to a folder named "movies"
>  - start another instance of rclone by adding the flag `--include "**{{(s|S)([0-9]+)( |.|e|E)}}**"` to your mount command, mount to a folder named "shows"

### :tv: Content Services:

*The services that plex_debrid can monitor for new content. You can pick any combination of services.*

><details>
>  <summary><b><u><img src="https://app.plex.tv/desktop/favicon.ico" height="16"> Plex watchlists:</u></b></summary>
>  
>  - The Plex Watchlist and the Discover feature are only available for accounts that are linked to an email address - so no managed accounts.
>  - To allow content download from inside any plex client by yourself and other users, create a new user by navigation to '/Settings/Content Services/Plex/Plex users/Edit/Add user'.
>  - You and the users you've added can now browse the Discover part of Plex and download content by adding it to the Plex Watchlist.
>  - If you want to delete something from your Plex server, make sure that you've removed it from your Watchlist first. Otherwise the script will see that its in your watchlist and not on your server and will simply download it again.
>  - By default, movies that you add to your Plex Watchlist are removed automatically once they are downloaded and shows stay in the Watchlist, because only shows that are in the Watchlist are monitored for newly released episodes. You can change which media type/s should be automatically removed from your watchlist by navigating to '/Settings/Content Services/Plex/Plex auto remove'
>  - The script tries its best to avoid downloading unwanted (e.g. sample) files. If samples still show up on plex, you can create a .plexignore file and add it to the mounts parent directory (more info [here](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201381883-special-keyword-file-folder-exclusion/)).
>  - The Plex Watchlist of your specified users will polled for changes every 5 seconds, which is when it will try to find newly added content. 
>  - The Plex Watchlist will be updated entirely every 30 minutes, which is when it will try to find newly released episodes from watchlisted series. This is only done every 30 minutes, because building the whole watchlist can take more than a minute, depending on the amount of shows you have in there.
>  - You can connect plex_debrid to trakt.tv to get more accurate release dates and times for your content, without needing to actually monitor any of your trakt content.
>

>
><details>
>  <summary><b><u><img src="https://walter.trakt.tv/hotlink-ok/public/favicon.ico" height="16"> Trakt watchlists, collections and public lists:</u></b></summary>
>  
>  - To connect the script to trakt, navigate to '/Settings/Content Services/Trakt/Trakt users/Edit/Add user'. You can add an unlimited amount of users.
>  - To monitor and download your users trakt watchlists, collections or public lists, navigate to '/Settings/Content Services/Trakt/Trakt lists'. By default, no trakt list is monitored for new content.
>  - Only movies and entire shows in the watchlists, public lists and collections are downloaded. Not single seasons or episodes (for now).
>  - The trakt watchlists of specified users is updated every 5s.
>  - Shows in the trakt collections of specified users are checked for newly released episodes every 30min.
>  - Public lists are updated every 30min.

### :magnet: Scraping Services:

*The services that plex_debrid can use to find torrents. You can add any combination of services. By default, torrentio is the only service enabled. You can connect more scraping services to make sure you find high quality, cached releases.*

>
><details>
>  <summary><b><u><img src="https://i.ibb.co/w4BnkC9/GwxAcDV.png" height="16"> torrentio (highly recommended):</u></b></summary>
>  
>  - The torrentio implementation uses the torrentio API to instantaniously get releases from torrentions gigantic release database. No actual scraping is done, which is why this service is so fast.
>  - You can enable torrentio by navigating to '/Settings/Scraper/Sources/Add/'. There are no other steps needed.
>  - You can edit the torrentio settings by navigating to '/Settings/Scraper/Sources/Edit/'. The settings menu will prompt you to visit 'https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure', where you can edit your settings. Your configuration "manifest url" will be copied to your clipboard after every change you make. You can paste that url into the plex_debrid setting to update your configuration. Dont enter your Debrid information, its not needed.

>  
>  - Its recommended to install "jackett", a program that wraps a huge amount of torrent indexers (https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett). Once installed, go to http://localhost:9117 and add a few of your favorite indexers. Enable the jackett server setting "CORS". Once the jackett setup is complete, you can enable jackett inside plex_debrid by navigating to '/Settings/Scraper/Sources/Edit/Add source/jackett'.
>  - You can now choose to use a specific debrid service for a specific torrent tracker by navigating to "/Settings/Debrid Services/Tracker specific Debrid Services". This comes in handy if you are using a private tracker that forces you to use a debrid service that will seed your torrents (e.g. debridlink,put.io).

><details>
>  <summary><b><u><img src="https://prowlarr.com/img/favicon-32x32.png" height="16"> prowlarr:</u></b></summary>
>  
>  - If you prefer Prowlarr over Jackett, you can integrate prowlarr into plex_debrid by navigating to '/Settings/Scraper/Sources/Edit/Add source/prowlarr'. Prowlarr has stricted rate limits than jackett for some indexers (e.g. 1337x), which could cause plex_debrid to timeout the request to prowlarr and therefore find less releases than jackett.
>  - You can now choose to use a specific debrid service for a specific torrent tracker by navigating to "/Settings/Debrid Services/Tracker specific Debrid Services". This comes in handy if you are using a private tracker that forces you to use a debrid service that will seed your torrents (e.g. debridlink,put.io).

>  - By default, only the top 5 links are fetched per scraping attempt and the links are sorted by "popularity", not the premium-only "best" attribute. This is done to be "free" account friendly, you can change these parameters in the orionoid source settings '/Settings/Scraper/Sources/Edit/Edit sources/orionoid'.

### <img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/1/4k-logo-0B1F5255A1-seeklogo.com.png" height="16"> Defining versions to download:

><details>
>  <summary><b><u>Defining versions to download:</u></b></summary>
>  
>  - Check out the Wiki for a complete documentation of the version settings: https://github.com/itsToggle/plex_debrid/wiki/Version-Guides
>  - You can define what release qualities plex_debrid should download by defining a "version". You can add an unlimited amount of versions by navigating to '/Settings/Scraper Settings/versions'. By default, plex_debrid only comes with 1 version definiton ([1080p SDR])
>  - versions consist of an unlimited amount of completely customizable "rules" and "triggers". 
>  - "Rules" define the quality requirements of your versions. The rules can be either formulated as a requirement or as a preference. The first rule has the highest priority, the last one the lowest. To give some examples, here are the rules that make up the default [1080p SDR] version:
>      
>        1)  cache status  requirement :   cached
>        2)  resolution    requirement :       <=  1080
>        3)  resolution    preference  :  highest
>        4)  title         requirement :  exclude  (H?D?.?CAM|H?D?.?TS)
>        5)  title         requirement :  exclude  (3D)
>        6)  title         requirement :  exclude  (DO?VI?)
>        7)  title         requirement :  exclude  (HDR)
>        8)  title         preference  :  include  (EXTENDED|REMASTERED)
>        9)  size          preference  :   lowest
>        10) seeders       preference  :  highest
>        11) size          requirement :       >=  0.1
>      
>  - "Triggers" define when plex_debrid should look for a version. You can add triggers that limit a version to a specific media type, or to specific movies/shows. You can define how many times plex_debrid should attempt to download a version and how many attempts should be made with other versions, before a version is attempted to be downloaded. Other triggers can limit a version to a specific genre or can limit a version to a specific user that requested the movie/show. Here are some of the possible triggers, given in an example of a 720p version that should only be looked for, if the media items in question are "shows" that have been released "before 2010", are not "Family Guy" or "Last week tonight", and no other version has been found for "5 attempts":
>      
>        A) media type    requirement :   shows
>        B) retries       requirement :       >=  5
>        C) retries       requirement :       <=  48
>        D) title         requirement :  exclude  (family.guy|last.week.tonight)
>        E) year          requirement :       <=  2010
>      
>  - Text based rule values are interpreted as regex definitions, are case-insensitive and use official regex syntax. check out regexr.com to try out your regex definitions, or visit our discord server to see how other people use versions.

## Limitations:

><details>
>  <summary><b><u>Plex Limitations:</u></b></summary>
>  
>  - If plex is chosen as the library collection service, trakt and overseerr content needs to be matched to the plex media type. In order to accurate match content from Overseerr and Trakt to Plex, its neccessary to have at least one movie and one show inside a library thats visible by plex_debrid. Thats because in order to accurately match content, a search by imdb/tmdb/tvdb ID is necessary - which currently only works by requesting a "Fix Match" call to an existing library item. Until Plex allows a universal search by ID, this is the best I can do.
>  - plex_debrid cannot destinguish between a truly empty library and a library that couldnt be reached because its offline (or not reachable for any other reason). In order to avoid unwanted behaviour, the script simply stops running whenever an empty library is encountered. You will need to manually add at least one media item to the libraries visible by plex_debrid, before the download automation can run savely.
>  - The plex discover api only provides release dates, not precise release times. Its recommended to connect the script to trakt.tv, which enables plex_debrid to find more accurate release dates and even find out if movies can be downloaded before their actual release date.
